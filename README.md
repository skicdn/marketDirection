Market Direction - Determining General Market Direction (test #1)

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the general direction/state of the market.  
The reason for this is the saying that most stocks follow the market. 

i.e. there is no 1 strategy that works best in all situations.  
Different strategies work better for different market conditions.
